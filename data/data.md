## Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

### Types of Machine Learning
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Reinforcement Learning

## Deep Learning
Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks) to analyze various factors of data.

## Applications of AI and ML
- Healthcare: Disease diagnosis and drug discovery
- Finance: Fraud detection and algorithmic trading
- Automotive: Self-driving cars
- Natural Language Processing: Chatbots and language translation

## Ethical Considerations
As AI becomes more prevalent, it's crucial to consider ethical implications such as:
- Privacy concerns
